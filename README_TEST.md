# Frontend challenge

Develop an application to manage restaurant orders. The proposal is to implement a clean and simple flow, disregarding actions that would potentially exist in such an application such as login, editing and canceling orders, etc.

## Instructions

- Clone this repository;
- Implement the project according to the requirements;
- KISS
- When finished, mail us your repo link to **augusto.russo@playkids.com**.

## Requirements

#### Prerequisites

- The application must be developed using React or Vue;
- Feel free to bootstrap the project using your own environment configuration;
- The application must have a single-page application (SPA) architecture;
- State management
  - for React: [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) or [mobx-state-tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/welcome);
  - for Vue you can use Vuex or similar.
- Must use [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/);
- Do not use any third party frameworks for styling (Bootstrap, TailwindCSS or similars);
- The application must have two main modules: **Orders** and **Billing**;
- The list of available products and prices must be obtained at: https://5ff37c3328c3980017b195e8.mockapi.io/api/products;
- Price values ​​must be treated as BRL (R$);
- The README must contain instructions about how to install the environment and run the application.

#### Layout

#### Orders

- Must have a detailed list of orders already made;
- There must be a button to create a new order;
- The flow to create a new order must have 4 steps:

    2. List of cards containing the available foods and their respective prices, with the possibility of choosing more than one type of food, specifying the quantity;
    3. List of cards containing the available drinks and their respective prices, with the possibility to choose more than one type of drink, specifying the quantity;
    4. Payment of the order with credit card, simulating the sending of the card data and the total amount to be paid.
- Each order must have an id, datetime, customer and details of the items ordered;
- The id and datetime of each order must be generated automatically.

#### Billing

- Should have a list of available products segmented by type (food and drink), showing the quantity and total (R$) sold by product, and the total (R$) of orders placed.

## Assessment

- File structure;
- Code quality;
